# Langevin-Dynamics

This notebook solves the two dimensional Langevin equation using a time-splitting integration method from [this paper](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.4802990). The particle density, fluid viscosity, temperature, potential, and the simulation duration can be varied interactively. Particle size is fixed at 2 $\mu m$ diameter and the time step is fixed at 0.5 ms.
